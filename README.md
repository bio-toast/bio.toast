# bio.toast - Bio for Developers
Pre-made your bio, you design it.

## How to use
1. Browse to [bio.toast.name/your-github-username](https://bio.toast.name/_/self)
2. There! That's your bio right there. It uses [Classless.css](https://classless.de/) by default.
3. To design your own bio, read [this](https://github.com/bio-toast/my-bio.toast/blob/main/README.md).
4. Not sure what should you use, but don't like the default design? You can [find](https://github.com/search?q=%22my-bio.toast%22&type=repositories) other designs that you can use or copy-paste [official designs](https://gist.github.com/lightly-toasted/5935b3c0b2ea337fe579133d0fd5b4db) that is made by [me](https://github.com/lightly-toasted).
